# Comm645-Final
This was a challenge. I failed to get all of my mixins to work, and it let me see where I need more focus.
This is a great tool, and once It clikced, made writing css quick and easy.
I had issues with the .gitignore not working with the .json files, ran through a few pages and read a lot about git which is a great tool as well.
In my final push, the files were ignored for whatever reason, maybe after i had them removed and reinstalled?
There's a few comments about ignoring these files in the .gitignore file.
